# Langchain Chat Bot Series

Welcome to the Langchain Chat Bot series repository! This project demonstrates how to build a chat bot using Langchain and various enhancements to make it more interactive and functional. The series is divided into several blog posts, each focusing on a different aspect of developing and extending the chat bot. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide code examples and tutorials that guide you through creating a console-based chat bot, adding memory to save the previous chat, and enhancing the bot with a user interface using Streamlit. The code and instructions are based on a series of blog posts that will help you learn and implement these features step-by-step.

## Blog Post Series

### 1. [Building a Simple Console ChatGPT Bot with Langchain](simple_chatgbt_chatbot/README.md)
In this blog post, we create a simple console-based chat bot using Langchain. We cover setting up the development environment, writing the code, and running the bot in the console.

### 2. [Extending Your Console ChatGPT Bot: Adding Chat History](simple_chatgpt_chatbot_with_memory/README.md)
In this blog post, we enhance our chat bot by adding the ability to save and restore chat history. This allows the bot to remember previous interactions, making conversations more coherent and contextually relevant. We explain how to update the prompt template, manage chat history in memory, and modify the main chat loop to incorporate past interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and follow the instructions in the individual README files for each blog post. Make sure to install the required packages and set up your environment as described.
